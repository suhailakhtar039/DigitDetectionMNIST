## Code Requirements
python 3.x with following modules installed

1. numpy
2. keras
3. MNIST database
4. Tensorflow

## Description
This is a 3 layers Sequential Artificial Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.

It achieved 96.51% of accuracy with this ANN trained on a CPU, which took me about a minute. No of epochs used are 5.
